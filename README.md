# Capstone_Project

The project is about analysing, exploring and finding any interesting trends in airplane crashes from 1921 till 2016 (August). Over 95 years of data including military transport accidents, cargo flights, commercial accidents, private jet and helicopter accidents.  Predicting fatalities range and survival range of any airplane crash and also time series prediction of average people die per year in future.

After learning everything about data science in the course and this project really helped in understanding and connecting the dots in bigger picture and follow the data science workflow. The biggest challenge was with data as extracting useful information from them, thats where data cleaning, data munging and wrangling techniques in python was useful. Example the location of the crash was like 'Over the Mediterranean Sea'  and Google Geocoding API is best in retrieving latitude and longitude for these location names which are not proper locations. 

- Capstone_part2 - notebook details about the first cleaning and EDA
- Extraction of lat and log - Google Geocoding API
- Capstone_part3 - notebook details about the machine learning algorithms & time series
- Capstone_part4 - details about technical summary with final fine tuning of the models.
